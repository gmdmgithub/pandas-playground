    the first 6 positions form the date of birth in the opposite direction. For a person born on July 30, 1985, his first 6 numbers are 850730;
    The following 3 positions constitute the daily birth counter. This figure is even for women and odd for men; â€¢ the last 2 positions constitute the check digit. This check digit is a sequence of 2 digits.

    - by the first 9 digits of the national number for persons born before 1 January 2000;
